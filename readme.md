1. Downsampled the original VRAI dataset into two strategies: (i) Balanced and (ii) Unbalanced
2. Performed preprocessing on the downsampled (balanced & unbalanced) dataset.
3. Performed K-nearest Neighbors algorithm on both balanced and unbalanced dataset strategies.
4. Performed simple and complex neural network on both - balanced and unbalanced dataset strategies. 
5. Performed transfer learning using ResNet-50. 
6. Performed simple and complex convolutional neural network on both balanced and unbalanced dataset strategies. 
7. Performed transfer learning using MobileNet-v2.
